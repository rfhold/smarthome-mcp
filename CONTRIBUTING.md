# Contributing

The repository implements hosted OAuth, authenticated MCP, and a bounded Home Assistant read integration. The generic Kuri `mcp` dependency uses a reviewed immutable Git revision.

Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) to locate canonical contracts and current validation boundaries.

## Local Commands

Rust commands require Rust 1.96 because `Cargo.toml` sets `rust-version = "1.96"`. Rust 1.95 rejects the project before tests run.

Run formatting, check, Clippy, and tests with Rust 1.96:

```bash
cargo +1.96.0 fmt --all -- --check
cargo +1.96.0 check --locked --all-targets --all-features
cargo +1.96.0 clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo +1.96.0 test --locked --all-features
```

These commands pass against the exact Kuri Git pin.

Build the private-dependency runtime image with BuildKit secret handling:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build \
  --build-arg REVISION=local \
  --secret id=gitconfig,src="$HOME/.gitconfig" \
  --secret id=git-credentials,src="$HOME/.git-credentials" \
  --tag smarthome-mcp:local \
  .
```

The secret source files must exist. BuildKit mounts them only for Cargo's fetch/build step.

Run Pulumi type checks and mock tests:

```bash
cd infra/pulumi
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun test index.test.ts
```

Do not treat a standalone `docker run` as a runtime smoke test. Startup requires PostgreSQL, an OAuth wrapping keyring, OIDC configuration, local OAuth settings, and Home Assistant credentials. See [the testing guide](docs/quality/testing.md) for current coverage.

For documentation-only changes:

1. Keep current state separate from planned behavior.
2. Update the owning document and its domain index.
3. Run `git diff --check`.
4. Verify that every relative Markdown link resolves.
5. Verify that every populated domain under `docs/` has a `README.md` index.

Do not commit, push, preview, deploy, or mutate an external system without explicit authority.

The `preview` stack is deployed by the main pipeline. The `prod` stack is initialized with zero resources. Do not run `pulumi preview` or `pulumi up` without explicit target-specific authority.
