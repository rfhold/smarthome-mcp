# Access and Authentication

## Status

This document defines the implemented hosted OAuth contract. Local tests cover selected validation, challenge, consent, and mocked OIDC behavior.

The service uses generic MCP-owned OIDC resource-owner support and PostgreSQL state. Generic migration V4 adds one-shot OIDC attempts and replaces the removed browser-state migration.

The service uses a reviewed immutable Kuri Git revision. Live PostgreSQL and Authentik validation is deployment evidence, not established by local tests.

## Protocol Boundary

`smarthome-mcp` hosts a local OAuth issuer for stateless MCP Streamable HTTP revision `2026-07-28`. The protected resource is the configured public URL whose path is exactly `/mcp`.

The resource value has exact-string semantics. Alternate origins, paths, query strings, fragments, and trailing-slash variants do not match.

Each `/mcp` request stands alone after token validation. The service requires no MCP session identifier and stores no MCP protocol session state.

Every MCP request must use a locally issued ES256 JWT access token. Each token must use JWT type `at+jwt` and contain scope `mcp:use`.

The endpoint-wide `mcp:use` scope authorizes all six progressive tools: the Home Assistant query and execution tools plus the Thread and Matter query and execution tools. There is no per-tool scope, so every valid token with `mcp:use` receives all implemented capabilities without a separate grant, consent, client registration, or issuer change. Entity operations still require fresh exact Assist exposure, but system-level Thread selection and Matter interview operations cannot use that entity authorization check. See the [common-control contract](../home-assistant/common-controls.md) and [Thread and Matter contract](../home-assistant/spec/thread-matter.md).

Authentik provides browser identity only. Authentik access tokens, ID tokens, and other Authentik credentials never authorize `/mcp`.

## Roles

| Actor | Role |
| --- | --- |
| MCP client | Discover metadata, identify or register itself, complete authorization, and call `/mcp`. |
| Generic Kuri `mcp` | Host OAuth metadata, OIDC resource-owner flow, token issuance, token validation, continuation, and durable OAuth state. |
| `smarthome-mcp` | Configure Authentik and map stable issuer-plus-subject identities to local principals. |
| Authentik | Authenticate the browser user during the hosted authorization flow. |
| PostgreSQL | Persist generic OAuth and OIDC state plus protected signing material in the `mcp` schema. |

## Discovery and Bearer Challenges

The service must publish protected-resource and authorization-server metadata for the configured public resource and local issuer.

An unauthenticated `/mcp` request must return HTTP 401. Its `WWW-Authenticate` header must use the `Bearer` scheme and a `resource_metadata` parameter with the absolute protected-resource metadata URL.

An invalid, expired, or incorrectly bound token must return HTTP 401 with Bearer error `invalid_token`. A valid token without `mcp:use` must return HTTP 403 with Bearer error `insufficient_scope` and scope `mcp:use`.

Challenges and OAuth errors must not include tokens, authorization codes, client secrets, signing material, or OIDC transaction values.

## Client Flows

The hosted issuer supports public MCP clients through these identification paths:

- Dynamic Client Registration (DCR);
- Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD); and
- explicit preregistration.

CIMD retrieval and DCR must preserve the hardened validation rules from the generic `mcp` crate. Redirect matching must reject open redirects and unregistered destinations.

Native clients from each supported identification path can use loopback HTTP redirects. The redirect host and path must match the registered value, and the runtime port can vary.

Authorization Code flows must require PKCE S256. The authorization request and issued code must remain bound to the client, redirect URI, exact resource, scope, and PKCE challenge.

## OIDC Resource Owner

Generic Kuri `mcp` owns the strict login and callback flow. It creates an expiring, one-shot OIDC transaction before redirecting to Authentik.

The generic flow owns state, nonce, upstream PKCE, ID-token verification, the identity-mapper seam, and hosted authorization continuation.

PostgreSQL persists only digests for state and correlation values. A secure transaction-specific cookie binds the browser to the callback.

The callback verifies state, nonce, PKCE, signature, issuer, audience, expiration, and authorization response integrity. Transaction completion is atomic and single-use.

`smarthome-mcp` requests the `openid profile email` scopes from Authentik and provisions their managed property mappings. It uses only the verified issuer and subject for principal identity.

`smarthome-mcp` does not own OIDC transaction persistence or callback protocol logic.

After successful authentication, hosted continuation approves only the configured `/mcp` resource and `mcp:use` scope. It rejects any different resource or scope.

Authentik session lifetime does not extend local authorization codes, access tokens, refresh generations, or OIDC transactions.

## OAuth Lifetimes

| State | Lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| Access token | 300 seconds |
| Authorization code | 300 seconds |
| Refresh generation | 86400 seconds |
| Refresh family | 2592000 seconds |
| Authorization transaction | 10 minutes |

The implementation must expire durable records and reject replay even before cleanup removes old rows.

## Token Contract

The local issuer signs access tokens with ES256. Each access token must:

- use the JWT `typ` value `at+jwt`;
- identify the configured local issuer exactly;
- bind its audience to the exact configured `/mcp` resource;
- remain within its validity interval; and
- contain `mcp:use` as an independently matched scope value.

The `/mcp` boundary must validate the signature, algorithm, token type, issuer, exact audience, time claims, and scope before MCP request handling.

OAuth authorization requests must use the exact resource. Token exchange and refresh must preserve that resource binding.

## Durable State and Key Protection

Generic Kuri migrations V1 through V3 own the hosted OAuth schema, signing keys, and client registration state. Migration V4 adds one-shot OIDC attempts with parent transaction cascades.

The generic dependency embeds and applies all four migrations in the `mcp` schema. No separate browser-state migration exists.

The issuer must persist ES256 signing material in encrypted form. A versioned wrapping-key file must encrypt and decrypt that material outside PostgreSQL.

The deployment must mount the wrapping key separately from database credentials. Loss of either boundary alone must not expose a usable signing key.

Database transactions must enforce expiry and atomic single-use behavior for authorization codes, refresh rotation, and OIDC transaction completion.

## Secret Boundaries

- The service must read Authentik, PostgreSQL, Home Assistant, and OAuth key material only from runtime secret sources.
- The service must send the Home Assistant token only in the REST `Authorization` header and WebSocket authentication message.
- Browser URLs, redirects, logs, traces, MCP content, health responses, and OAuth errors must not contain secret values.
- The service must not persist plaintext OAuth signing keys.
- Build output and container layers must not contain private Git or provider credentials.
- Production requires separate target-specific approval and validated rotation and recovery procedures.
